radare2 releasing rules
=======================

The objective of this paper is to determine a set of rules to be done before
each release and define the instructions for generating the distribution
tarball together with a scheduler.


* We try to release every 1/2 months
* Version numbering (actually we dont follow any rules for this)

Before any release we have to:

 - Remove warnings

   We dont want to fall in the warning nightmare of r1. Releases should contain
   no warnings with gcc -Wall or at least no dangerous ones.

 - Sync Vala APIs

   Keeping the VAPI files the last ones to be developed between release cycles
   we ensure that we do not have to maintain synced the code with the vapis
   and it is possible to easily draw the LIBR API evolution by just diffing
   the vapi directory.

 - Unit test programs

   If available, it would be good to have some unit tests to check nothing is
   broken. Maybe Vala is the way to go when writing tests, because this way
   we ensure that pkg-config, libr and vapis works in a shot.
