Syntax coding style guidelines
==============================

I will try to not being a boring document like most of already available
coding style guidelines ;) Here'r some rules:


* Do not bypass 78 columns

* Use tabs instead of space based indentation
  - The code should be smart enought to do not bypass 78 columns
    using 5 space indentation.

* function opens brackets at next line
* do/for/if/while open brackets at same line
* Commas and keywords should be followed by a space. f.ex:
  if (blabl)
  foo(one, two);

* Do not use C99 variable declaration
  - This way we reduce the number of local variables per function
    and it's easier to find which variables are used, where and so on.

* Comments should be smart. Function names should be enought explicit
  to not require a comment to explain what it does. If this is not
  possible at all, we can still use a comment. But it is a bad idea
  to relay on comment to make the code readable.

* Use 'R_API' define to mark exportable methods
