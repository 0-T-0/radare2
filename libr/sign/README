r_sign: signature api for radare2
=================================

---
 - Try to identify only the given functions
 - Raw signature search
---

Plugins are used to implement data collectors for r_sign.

A data collector is a piece of code that feeds the r_sign
database with information about symbols.

r_sign is configured to weight each attribute with some properties
to be able to determine the semblance between a collector source
information and the playground where r_sign tries to find valid
duplicates of the information stored previously following the
configured attributes and then we have output plugins to 

Plugin types:
=============
collectors - collects initial signatures (libc, libm, ...)        [  INPUT ]
playground - find collected info using the configured attributes  [  INPUT ]
dumpers    - dump the resulting information in ascii              [ OUTPUT ]
             - dump signature
             - dump results of the signature analysis

Items in stored database
========================
Should contain something like:

 // raw byte search //
 typedef struct {
     char *name;
     ut8 *bytes;
     int len;
     RList hits;
 } RSignItem;

We need some way to store other kind of properties for signature types..

r_sign_item_new ();
r_sign_item_add (sign, s_item);


Matchers should allow some ranges.. for example. we can accept two matching sequences with a distance of X
