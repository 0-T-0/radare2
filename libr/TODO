|| config ||
------------
  - find/use more common cases for char* or &int maps
    - automatic callbacks for most common usecases

|| socket ||
------------
* Merge r_socket inside r_util ?
* Add SSL support to r_socket ?

|| asm || 
---------
  - Add CIC, lua, dalvik, xtensa (mm cpu) disassemblers
  - http://git.linux-xtensa.org/cgi-bin/git.cgi?p=buildroot/buildroot-xtensa;a=blob;f=toolchain/binutils/binutils-xtensa_dc232b.tgz;h=214164399158c540a3033e52b3bb9f65c55289af;hb=HEAD
  - Check if there are endianess issues

|| anal ||
----------
  - anal fastargs
  - integrate with r_var to make variable access analysis

|| bin || 
---------
  - Add dex format support (android)
  - rename characteristics into srwx

|| cons ||
----------
  - add pipe_to_buffer..not only file descriptors

|| flags ||
-----------
  - We probably need more methods..or less ? :)
  - support to define relations between flags
    (flag hirearchies)
	r_flagtree
	 - r_flags should have a tree construction to access to them faster
	   - btree? following pointers like bigger,smaller
	    { struct r_flag_t *bigger, *smaller; }
	   - hooks r_flag_add to recalculate in r_flag_optimize(), bigger/smaller pointers
	   - hooks r_flag_del to recalculate too.
	 - the r_flag_get by string should have another construction with btree
	   for the string of the name

|| diff ||
----------
  - Reimplement or fix the delta diffing in C
    - first we need to do it for ired..

|| lib ||
---------
  - Cleanup and test w32/osx support
  - Added lib_handle stub in r_lib, so we can add plugin support to
    any library by using just a macro. will this help in Vala plugins?
