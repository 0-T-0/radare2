Debugger TODO
=============
* Breakpoints are ignored in some situations.. we must check
  for them and toggle a .dbg variable to break
* ALL threads must be stopped when a breakpoint is handled..
  -- how to do this?
* floating point registers
* mmx/xmm
* DRX control
* Implement dump+restore as macros
  (dump,)
* regio not implemented // really necessary?
