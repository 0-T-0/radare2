  Debugger API for radare2


We need to connect multiple pieces...

debugger engine: vm, qemu, bochs, ptrace, mach, w32dbg...

controlflow commands: (should be splitted in two layers)

 - continue -- low level
 - step     -- low level
 - trace   --- high level one
 - ...

 the control flow commands depend on other stuff to decide
 how to work..this is for example if the arch doesnt supports
 continuation, we should provide a step based continue. The
 same when a watchpoint is activated and the arch didnt
 supports hardware regs for this purpose.

We also need a load/store/dump/restore functions to move the
program from one engine to another (ptrace -> qemu).. we should
provide a way for all this operations between them.
