* Library to handle register values for multiple architectures
* Architecture register sets are handled as plugins?
* Designed to be used from radare libr within the modules:
  - r_vm : to properly setup the per-architecture register configuration
  - r_debug : to get/set register values
  - r_core : to display register values in 'd' (debug) command. dr

---------------------------------
We will have to split up every arch into a plugin
- define an API to access to registers and get information about the type of regs.
- we can base this stuff as in r_vm is done
