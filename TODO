<{include libr/TODO}>

0.5 RELEASE
===========

Questions:
----------
* #md5 #sha1 #entropy ...
* vsize=>vs, vaddr=>va, size=>sz ??? in 'S' command
* There's dup of info between RMeta and RAnal .. functions.. oh fuck!
* imports from PE doesnt works with /a because there's an indirect call
* rabin2 doesnt works for osx-x86 mach0 bins..so io.va=1 fails
* Store version information in libraries ? debian claims for it
* Load symbol information from libraries (only the ones imported by rabin2?)
* Implement 'av' command we need it  (really?) how about to eval with ?
* filter search results..?  cc 8080 @@ hit* .. check for values that has changed.

Bugs:
-----
* Vu doesnt seems to work always fine :/
* Cx/CX are not displayed in disasm as they should.. (C! must die)
* if we use objcopy --stripsymbols on a library..the stripped symbols are not
  listed by nm or rabin..but objcopy is able to see them O_O
* anal bug: (fixed??)
[0x08048eec]> pd 2 
    0x08048eec    0               c20400  ret 0x4
 -> this opcodes increments the stack 8 bytes (4+4) . it is not handled correctly


TODO:
-----
* Add 'prj.name', 'prj.desc'
* port r_sign to RList
* pancake: implement callback for conditional breakpoints
* nibble: trace counts after step..thats not correct!
######### * implement grep{col,row}
* nibble: mach0 new binary format is not supported by bin_mach0 :(
* Implement r_sys_setenv stuff from r1 in core/file.c:33 (!!?)
* Implement visual selection of bytes
* pancake: FileDescriptors: dd -- copy from !fd in r1
* pancake: we need an api to define function signatures
  - arg/var set name/get value/ ..
  - CF* must be used to define function shit
  - integrated with function signatures
  - offset -> formatstring (offset is the key to function signature)
* pancake: implement RAnalCall (analyze function arguments, return values, propagate types..)
  - define number of arguments for given function
  - warn if signature and analysis differs in number of args or so..
* gerardo?: implement GMP in util/big.c
* nibble: diff code analysis
  - diff two programs
     1st level:
        - check all functions EQUAL, DIFFERENT, REMOVED, ADDED
        - check all symbols
        - check all imports
        - check all strings
     2nd level:
        - basic block level diffing (output in graph mode)

0.6
===
* rasign2 : must be done, write manpage
* distribute 'spp' with 'rarc2' ?
* Initial analysis looking for xrefs to strings and so? ax? ./a@@entry0 - Launched at startup

Transaction notes
=================
Loading big binaries results on broken interaction.
  - Optimize bottlenecks
    - Index flags by name and offset
    - Dont walk all the entries all the time
    - Use RDB or RHashMap
  - Cache
    - We can just cache the last N used pointers to resolve them faster
    - Should work fine for disassembling and others
  - Transactions and threads
    - BIGLOCK is enought i think
    - A background thread can load rabin info
    - r_th is required
    - We need a way to get 'status' info from thread (msg passing?)
      - r_th_msg
    - We can lock the loading thread when a shell command is going to be executed
      |
      |--- (while (prompt,lock,run,unlock))
      \
       `-- (while (lock,load,unlock))

Analysis
========
* Implement more get_main() (NOOB)
* code analysis with r_parse // isnt this already done? nibble?
  - generate by just parsing the opcode
  - RAnalAopArg { int size; int delta; int type; }
  - r_anal_aop_arg_set (); r_anal_aop_arg_get (); r_anal_aop_arg_binmask ();

Bindings
========
* generate accessors automatically from valaswig
* Script plugins
 - We should enable r_lib to implement plugins in any
   scripting language, so we can for example prepare
   a .c stub interface for python/perl/ruby/..
   - this requires a swig bridge

Build system
============
* install.sh (to track installed files ..)

Refactoring
===========
* Add RLog API.. pipeable to disk and stderr..also hookable ..cool for ui
* Move disasm loop into r_print (r_print should depend on r_asm)
  - thats hard :)
* Move 'r_syscall_t' stuff into r_debug (sync r_core)
* merge r_asm and r_anal?
* Implement r_bind api to link multiple pointers
  core->asm = r_bind_set (core->asm->bind, r_asm_new ());
* what do we have to do with r_th, r_parse and r_vm ?
* Is RCore->block and blocksize a RBuf ? refactor!11
* Find a better name for r_buf_fread (really?)
* typedef all function pointers, like in r_bp
* Review r_io API
* rasm2 should be configurable at startup time to choose default arch (use env?)
* semi-ok state (R_TRUFAE), implement r_errno and r_errstr in r_util?
* Finish and import the spp's getopt owns implementation in r_util (like in p9)
* Rename __UNIX__ as __POSIX__
 
Future
======
* radare2 -e dbg.engine=vm -d ls
  - load the program using r_bin in virtual space
  - initialize vm and set regs
  - debug backend should use the vm
