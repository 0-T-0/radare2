Visual mode
-----------
- cursor mode by default? (imho no)
- cursor can move outside screen (visual broken)
- scrollup by bwdisasm not yet implemented

aoe = anal op exec
/a ??? deprecated analyze code? srsly?
* Search for wide strings /Z or so? /w maybe?

pancake
-------
* Fix r2 rap://:9999 and c2s comms
* r2-swig : Distribute generated .i files and cxx files.. so build is faster
* comparisions doesnt works (RAnalCond)
* Fix iterators for r_macro (test only?)
* Fix help of ? command, and add ?! and check ??
* Fix <tab> in console (if entered 'a<tab> and flags are: 'aburo' and 'abuelo', must autocomplete to 'abu'
* keys to modify flags and functions

earada
------
* Fix avr/ppc code analysis // fix or use or what? :)
* Implement print Zoom mode (copypasta from r1) (useful for forensics) <-- MUST
* mount /mnt/ must chop last '/'
* test fatfs and others

nibble
------
* '+' key in visual cursor mode only increments lower nibble!
  - only in debugger mode :/
* register renaming (per-instruction or ranges)
  - r_parser fun? a specific asm.parser plugin that does all this tricks?
- fix instruction navigation
  - do not allow to disassemble unaligned addresses (toggle)
  - use 'jk' with bwdisasm to go up to previous opcode.
    - r_asm can reduce cpu without disasm on fixed size ops archs.
* not identified as cmp instruction by analysis. (85f6  test esi, esi)
* x86im plugin does not detects int instructions (i have workaround it, but hacks sucks here)

0.7 release
===========
	* GMP
	  - big-ssl.c big-gmp.c ...
	  - implement GMP in util/big.c
	    - http://etutorials.org/Programming/secure+programming/Chapter+7.+Public+Key+Cryptography/7.5+Generating+a+Prime+Number+Testing+for+Primality/

	DEBUGGER: (pancake)
	---------
	* Implement DRX support
	* Implement dump+restore as macros (dump,)
	* Implement software stepping (with code analysis+breakpoints)
	* Implement dbg.bep - in r_core? in r_debug after attach? maybe only in r2 binr?
	  - must be refined.. and look for better names

	CORE
	----
	* Add "pm ?" for bit print like in pb? bit level binary memory printage
	- add support for PDB files
	- Handle ^C in searches (at least)
	- Add support for DEX file format
	- display filesize info instead of virtual space address limit
	- "wx jeje" does not says "invalid hexpair string" (must report error)
	- allow to hook r_asm_disassemble and assemble with custom callbacks
	  - extend a disassembler with own instructions.
	- r_bin_demangle ();
		* _ZN7WebCore11CounterNode7recountERKNS_12AtomicStringE
		  - demangle c++ and objc names
		    WebCore.CounterNode.recount(AtomicString)
		  _ZN = begin of stream
		  0-9+ = count of chars
		  E = end of stream
		  RKNS_ = start of arguments


	Assembler
	---------
	* Embed bits/arch/endian in a separated structure
	  - So one can change from one arch to another with a pointer
	  - Cool for defining ranges of memory

0.8
===
* Reimplement or fix the delta diffing in C - first we need to do it for ired..
* add support for .a files (r_fs supports cpio and ar archives...)
* Implement rap:// upload/download protocol commands (maybe just system() with rsc2+wget?
* code injection facilities? (wtf? insert,execute, restore)
* Trace contents of buffers: filter search results..?  cc 8080 @@ hit* .. check for values that has changed.
* Record trace of register status for each function when running
  - r_reg_arena_copy();
* Create radare2-testsuite project
  - tests for ired, rax2, radare2, rabin2 ...
* Is RCore->block and blocksize a RBuf ? refactor!11
* Add support for STATIC_PLUGINS in r_lang
  - r_lang_define is implemented in lang.c, but requires the collaboration
    of the plugins to properly setup the environment for the script execution.
  - Add support for STATIC_PLUGINS in r_lang
  - dlerror(/usr/lib/radare2/lang_perl.so): libperl.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
    This issue is fixed by setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH...looks like dlopen ignores rpath

Things to improve in r2
=======================
* focus in single arch (rock allover) mips, ppc64 or arm?
* code analysis must resolve jump tables
* Enhace code analysis
  - calculate multiple execution paths to give branch prediction results
    - get/set register status of the vm
    - analyze from various parent functions and resolve ranged values
    - a ranged value can be:
      - ut64 from, to
      - restrict : %2 (module)
      - ...
* Add support for aout binaries?
* eprintf should be modified to log into a file
  - eprintf_open() -- start log to file
  - eprintf_close() -- stop log to file

Debugger
========
* stepover waits for one unknown event that cannot be stopped
* Implement list threads on ALL supported platforms (win,lin,osx)
* ALL threads must be stopped when a breakpoint is handled..
* Add support for windbg+virtualkd
* Floating point registers
* MMX/XMM/DRX control

pancake
-------
* Add SSL support to r_socket
* Implement PTRACE_BLOCK on Linux
* fork/clone child . inject code to create new threads or pids
* Functions in r_util to get lil/big ut8,16,32 from ut8*
  - already done..must find better names probably
* merge asm.arch vm.arch
* support for macro scripting
* better debugger support for OSX and iOS
* rarc2 allows to compile invalid code like calling puts() out of context
* Implement RAnalCall (analyze function arguments, return values, propagate types..)
  - define number of arguments for given function
  - warn if signature and analysis differs in number of args or so..
  - when calling a function
    - identify arguments passed and compare with arguments required
    - if they do not match: we need to warn/ask user/store multiple options
       - function signature comparsion if they dont match
       r_anal_fcn_cmp (anal, f1, f2);

nibble
------
* Display getsym() stuff in rabin2, not only legit syms
* Check if python plugin works from inside
  - write tuto, how to call py code from shell or r2
* dmi command must read from memory if no file path provided
  - rabin from memory ftw
  - to get libnames of dll, so..
* add support for sign/unsigned registers..or at least a way to cast them
* r_anal
  - use r_anal_value everywhere
  - x86im
    - make x86_x86im the default backend for x86 analysis
* diff code analysis
  - diff two programs
     1st level:
        - check all functions EQUAL, DIFFERENT, REMOVED, ADDED
        - check all symbols
        - check all imports
        - check all strings
     2nd level:
        - basic block level diffing (output in graph mode)

earada
------
* r_file_slurp should work fine for big files (not prio) r_file_slurp_buf?
  - mmap if supported
  - add r_file_mmap ?
  - read file in blocks instead of the whole file in a single syscall
* remove all uses of alloca() // mingw and grep reports them all :)
* typedef all function pointers, like in r_bp
* Implement /A : search AES
* Implement case-insensitive search (e search.casematters ?) any better name? Use /i?
* Implement /. to search using a file .. isnt zignatures about this?
* Implement /p to search for patterns
  - implement it in r_core ?? or add r_io_bind support
* Implement search and replace /s
  - insert or append? (see r1 cfg vars)


Questions
=========
* Only use uppercase KMG for Kilo,Mega,Giga in r_num? - 'g' is for double
* radare2.c:217 . find name for maxfilesize to hash
* r_list_foreach_prev is buggy, review and remove..
* make symstall in swig/ ?
* What about rsc2 ? deprecate, maintain? cleanup from 1? build? install?
* Add deltified offset in PC? +10, +30 ... asm.reladdr
* regio not implemented // it is really necessary? imho no..
* distribute 'spp' with 'rarc2' ? imho no


Bindings
========
* generate accessors from valaswig ? why?
* Script plugins
 - We should enable r_lib to implement plugins in any
   scripting language, so we can for example prepare
   a .c stub interface for python/perl/ruby/..
   - this requires a swig bridge

Refactoring
===========
* Import r_vm register values from flags or from r_debug->r_reg
  - r_vm must use mmu cache when emulating code
    - use the one from r_io? and deprecate vm->mmu_cache?
* Review the r_flags api
* Add pipe_to_buffer..not only file descriptors
* r_config set_int and so..simplify
  - find/use more common cases for char* or &int maps
    - automatic callbacks for most common usecases
* What do we have to do with r_th, r_vm ?
* Merge r_vm into r_anal ?
* Merge r_socket inside r_util ?
* Discuss missing r_core_sysenv_update in core/file.c:33
* Add RLog API.. pipeable to disk and stderr..also hookable ..cool for ui (partially done)
* Move disasm loop into r_print (r_print should depend on r_asm)
  - thats hard :)
* Move 'r_syscall_t' stuff into r_debug (sync r_core)
* Implement r_bind api to link multiple pointers
  core->asm = r_bind_set (core->asm->bind, r_asm_new ());
* Find a better name for r_buf_fread (really?)
* Review r_io and r_reg API
* semi-ok state (R_TRUFAE), implement r_errno and r_errstr in r_util?
  - useful in r_sys_mkdir ?
* Finish and import the spp's getopt owns implementation in r_util (like in p9)

 
Future
======
* Realign flags when using project in debug mode
* FileDescriptors: dd -- copy from !fd in r1
* Initial analysis looking for xrefs to strings and so? ax? ./a@@entry0 - Launched at startup
* install.sh (to track installed files ..)
* acr -ldl check must be fixed for kfreebsd
* Add support for float/double in r_num :?
* radare2 -e dbg.engine=vm -d ls
  - load the program using r_bin in virtual space
  - initialize vm and set regs
  - debug backend should use the vm
* metaflags? support to define relations between flags
    (flag hirearchies)
	r_flagtree
	 - r_flags should have a tree construction to access to them faster
	   - btree? following pointers like bigger,smaller
	    { struct r_flag_t *bigger, *smaller; }
	   - hooks r_flag_add to recalculate in r_flag_optimize(), bigger/smaller pointers
	   - hooks r_flag_del to recalculate too.
	 - the r_flag_get by string should have another construction with btree
	   for the string of the name
