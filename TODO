<{include libr/TODO}>

0.6 RELEASE
===========
* Trace contents of buffers: filter search results..?  cc 8080 @@ hit* .. check for values that has changed.
* Meld r_meta inside r_anal
* Cx/CX are not displayed in disasm as they should.. (C! must die)
* Create radare2-testsuite project
* Implement remote:// socket:// and listen://

Build system:
-------------
* Write documentation about how to build r2, r2-swig, valaswig, make symstall and
  some basics about the organization of the code (boring++)
* Store version information in libraries ? debian claims for it
* install.sh (to track installed files ..)
* acr -ldl check must be fixed for kfreebsd

TODO nibble
-----------
* imports from PE doesnt works with /a because there's an indirect call
* r_bin->relocs // RList of relocations
* Support indirect references on /a and similars.. (e search.refptr) .. or /A?
* big-ssl.c big-gmp.c ...
* native fat bins support (push uncommited changes)
* diff code analysis
  - diff two programs
     1st level:
        - check all functions EQUAL, DIFFERENT, REMOVED, ADDED
        - check all symbols
        - check all imports
        - check all strings
     2nd level:
        - basic block level diffing (output in graph mode)

TODO edu
--------
* Implement more get_main()
* typedef all function pointers, like in r_bp
* Implement /A : search AES
* Implement case-insensitive search (e search.casematters ?) any better name? Use /i?
* Implement /. to search using a file .. isnt zignatures about this?
* Implement /p to search for patterns
* Implement search and replace /s

TODO pancake
------------
* Implement fcn_from_string anal/fcn.c
  - define function signature command: (afs? CF?)
  > afs int foo(int var, char* str) @ fun.main
  - How to define function variables? CFv? CFa for args?
* Display syscall information when disassembling svc/int/.. (edu?)
  - store last value of REG0 (EAX, R0, ...), select interrupt vector by aop->value and use r_syscall()
* we need an api to define function signatures
  - CF<addr> void name(int foo, char* var)
  - arg/var set name/get value/ ..
* implement RAnalCall (analyze function arguments, return values, propagate types..)
  - define number of arguments for given function
  - warn if signature and analysis differs in number of args or so..
* Implement r_sys_setenv stuff from r1 in core/file.c:33 (!!?)

TODO gerardo
------------
* http://etutorials.org/Programming/secure+programming/Chapter+7.+Public+Key+Cryptography/7.5+Generating+a+Prime+Number+Testing+for+Primality/
* implement GMP in util/big.c

unassigned TODO pointz
----------------------
* Realign flags when using project in debug mode
* FileDescriptors: dd -- copy from !fd in r1
* distribute 'spp' with 'rarc2' ?
* Initial analysis looking for xrefs to strings and so? ax? ./a@@entry0 - Launched at startup

Bindings
========
* generate accessors automatically from valaswig
* Script plugins
 - We should enable r_lib to implement plugins in any
   scripting language, so we can for example prepare
   a .c stub interface for python/perl/ruby/..
   - this requires a swig bridge

Refactoring
===========
* Add RLog API.. pipeable to disk and stderr..also hookable ..cool for ui (partially done)
* Move disasm loop into r_print (r_print should depend on r_asm)
  - thats hard :)
* Move 'r_syscall_t' stuff into r_debug (sync r_core)
* Implement r_bind api to link multiple pointers
  core->asm = r_bind_set (core->asm->bind, r_asm_new ());
* r_config set_int and so..simplify
* what do we have to do with r_th, r_parse and r_vm ?
* Find a better name for r_buf_fread (really?)
* Review r_io API
* semi-ok state (R_TRUFAE), implement r_errno and r_errstr in r_util?
  - useful in r_sys_mkdir ?
* Finish and import the spp's getopt owns implementation in r_util (like in p9)

0.7
===
* Is RCore->block and blocksize a RBuf ? refactor!11
 
Future
======
* radare2 -e dbg.engine=vm -d ls
  - load the program using r_bin in virtual space
  - initialize vm and set regs
  - debug backend should use the vm

Transaction notes
=================
Loading big binaries results on broken interaction.
  - Optimize bottlenecks
    - Index flags by name and offset
    - Dont walk all the entries all the time
    - Use RDB or RHashMap
  - Cache
    - We can just cache the last N used pointers to resolve them faster
    - Should work fine for disassembling and others
  - Transactions and threads
    - BIGLOCK is enought i think
    - A background thread can load rabin info
    - r_th is required
    - We need a way to get 'status' info from thread (msg passing?)
      - r_th_msg
    - We can lock the loading thread when a shell command is going to be executed
      |
      |--- (while (prompt,lock,run,unlock))
      \
       `-- (while (lock,load,unlock))
* Implement 'av' command we need it  (really?) how about to eval with ?
