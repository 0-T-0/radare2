----------------------------------------[ todo 
* if we use objcopy --stripsymbols on a library..the stripped symbols are not
  listed by nm or rabin..but objcopy is able to see them O_O

* rasm2 should be configurable at startup time to choose default arch (use environment?)
* store version information in libraries ?
* public delegate void RangeEachFunc(int i);
* public void each(RangeEachFunc each_func) { ... }
* r_io must need a reviewd undo API

<{include libr/TODO}>
 
* correct result (R_TRUFAE), but with warnings (implement r_errno and r_errstr in r_util?)
  - Quantic computation ftw \o/
* r_cmd must provide a nesting char table indexing for commands
  - this is pretty similar to r_db
  - every module can register their own commands
  - commands can be listed like in a tree
* 'Vc' cursor mode makes color toggle

* Finish and import the spp's getopt owns implementation in r_util (like in p9)

* Add maxrows option for r_print (fix visual problem)
* Drop #if conditionals to use #ifdef ones
  - fits better with plan9 compiler
  - use getopt() p9-like macros

* Add test for config.c with _set_cb
* Rename __UNIX__ as __POSIX__
* Strip non input symbols in plugins (speed up loading)
* Specify binmask in hexpairs
  - wx 1234:ff0f
  - /x 1234:ff0f

* radare2 -e dbg.engine=vm -d ls
  - load the program using r_bin in virtual space
  - initialize vm and set regs
  - debug backend should use the vm

* Script plugins
 - We should enable r_lib to implement plugins in any
   scripting language, so we can for example prepare
   a .c stub interface for python/perl/ruby/..
 - Maybe having a preprocessor tool for this..

Vala issues
===========
** in a vapi file you can define a different constructor class Foo { bar Bar(); }.. 
   definition of Bar will override the previous Bar() class definition
** .h is not included correctly for each vapi maybe its about order???
